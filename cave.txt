Z = SUM((1 - Di/G) * Zi) / SUM(Di/G)


randomly generate N points
 
# begin in the middle
pick the center-most point
pick its nearest neighbor
create that connection
add points to graph
 
trim off outliers (n% > distance from central node than average)
 
# connect the graph
while not every point is on the graph
  find the nearest point not on the graph
  find its nearest neighbor that is on the graph
  create connection
  add point to graph
  
# find interesting loop-forming connections that don't cause problems
